// Here you learn about variable

// In js basicaly you declear the variables in three ways

// 1. using const which you cannot reinisilised after ones initialize
const email = "reddy@123"

// 2. using let
let name = "pratik"

// 3. using var
var city = "berhampur"

/* 
Prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope
*/

// you can print using console
console.log(email)

// Here you learn thing print all the variable values in a tabular form
console.table([email, name, city])
